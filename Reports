### Setting the scope
The current reporting scope is displayed at the top of the page and is used when any report is generated. This scope consists of the **DATA** dropdown and a **LEVEL** in the active **HIERARCHY** as well as an optional **FILTER**. You can change this scope before or after you run the report.

### Working with the report
Once the report is generated you can perform an alphanumeric sort on any column by clicking on the columnâ€™s header. 
When more columns are available that will display on the screen, a plus icon will appear in the left most column allowing you to expand a row to see all remaining data fields. You can also view the report in full page mode to scroll through all the contents of a report.

### Viewing Full Page
All reports, both summary and detail, can be viewed full page. Toggle full page view with the button located above the table.

### Editing the report
At any time, you can edit the underlying report template. Any changes will be immediately reflected in the report output. The edit button is located above the table.

### Scheduling a report
Reports can be scheduled for delivery via email to you and others that you designate on a recurring schedule. If reports are too large to be emailed, you can download them from the Orders tab within the product. 

### Large Reports
In some instances with large data sets, you may be prompted to order a report. If a report cannot be displayed in real-time, you will be automatically redirected to the Order Report page where you can place a one-time order for the report in the file format of your choice.

### Removing a report
You can remove reports that you do not find useful at any time. Be careful when deleting a predefined report as it cannot be restored once deleted.
